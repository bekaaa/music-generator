# Music Generator
- Using LSTM NN and tensorflow, I'm building a Piano music generator with a modified and optimized loss function.
- Also I'm providing a new data structure to hold input, logits and output data.
- Project is still in progress and I'm hoping to reach good results.
- project started in late march.
- Main scripts are under lib/ directory, notebooks used for debugging are in drafts/, music input are under music/,
  saved output files are under data/ and model checkpoints are under checkpoints/ .
